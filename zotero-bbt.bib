  abstract = {The recent discovery of graphene has sparked much interest, thus far focused on the peculiar electronic structure of this material, in which charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particles. However, the physical structure of graphene\textemdash{}a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice\textemdash{}is also puzzling. On the one hand, graphene appears to be a strictly two-dimensional material, exhibiting such a high crystal quality that electrons can travel submicrometre distances without scattering. On the other hand, perfect two-dimensional crystals cannot exist in the free state, according to both theory and experiment. This incompatibility can be avoided by arguing that all the graphene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger three-dimensional structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a three-dimensional matrix. Here we report on individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabricated scaffold in vacuum or air. These membranes are only one atom thick, yet they still display long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission electron microscopy also reveal that these suspended graphene sheets are not perfectly flat: they exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1\,nm. The atomically thin single-crystal membranes offer ample scope for fundamental research and new technologies, whereas the observed corrugations in the third dimension may provide subtle reasons for the stability of two-dimensional crystals.},

  title = {Intrinsic Ripples in Graphene},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is the subject of a long-standing theoretical debate. According to the so-called Mermin\textendash{}Wagner theorem, long-wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order of 2D crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled. These fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes meaning that a 2D membrane can exist but will exhibit strong height fluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal, and the recent experimental observation of ripples in suspended graphene make these issues especially important. Besides the academic interest, understanding the mechanisms of the stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic transport in this material that is attracting so much interest owing to its unusual Dirac spectrum and electronic properties. We address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear owing to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution peaked around 80\,\AA\, which is compatible with experimental findings (50\textendash{}100\,\AA{}). This unexpected result might be due to the multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.},

The buckling strain for the supported boundary condition is found to be independent of the longitudinal size and estimated to be 0.86\%.

For the points of this surface, force components T x , T y , and T xy have been calculated. It is shown that graphene is structurally stable up to strains on the order of 0.3\textendash{}0.4, but it is unstable with respect to the shear in the absence of stretching forces. In addition, graphene cannot preserve its flat shape under the effect of a compressive force since it has zero flexural stiffness.},

Efficiency is achieved by exploiting properties of linear interpolants in a neighborhood of a local minimizer. High accuracy is achieved by using a convergence criterion, which we call the ‘‘approximate Wolfe' conditions, obtained by replacing the sufficient decrease criterion in the Wolfe conditions with an approximation that can be evaluated with greater precision in a neighborhood of a local minimum than the usual sufficient decrease criterion.

It is shown that, due to the weak interaction between graphene layers, many features of this system can be understood by interference conditions between the quantum states of the two layers, mathematically expressed as Diophantine problems. Based on this general analysis we demonstrate that while the Dirac cones from each layer are always effectively degenerate, the Fermi velocity vF of the Dirac cones decreases as \texttheta$\rightarrow$0$^\circ$; the form we derive for vF(\texttheta{}) agrees with that found via a continuum approximation in [J. M. B. Lopes dos Santos, N. M. R. Peres, and A. H. Castro Neto, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 256802 (2007)]. From tight-binding calculations for structures with 1.47$^\circ\leq$\texttheta$<$30$^\circ$ we find agreement with this formula for \texttheta$\greaterequivlnt$5$^\circ$. In contrast, for \texttheta$\lessequivlnt$5$^\circ$ this formula breaks down and the Dirac bands become strongly warped as the limit \texttheta$\rightarrow$0 is approached. For an ideal system of twisted layers the limit as \texttheta$\rightarrow$0$^\circ$ is singular as for \texttheta$>$0 the Dirac point is fourfold degenerate, while at \texttheta{}=0 one has the twofold degeneracy of the AB stacked bilayer. Interestingly, in this limit the electronic properties are in an essential way determined globally, in contrast to the ``nearsightedness'' [W. Kohn, Phys. Rev.

Calculating these properties is straightforward when the device is made from a pure material, but problems arise when alloys are used.

Unfolding methods [Boykin, Kharche, Klimeck, and Korkusinski, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 19, 036203 (2007)] have proven very useful for tight-binding calculations of alloy electronic structure without the problems in the VCA, and the mathematical analogy between tight-binding and valence-force-field approaches to the phonon problem suggests they be employed here as well. However, there are some differences in the physics of the two problems requiring modifications to the electronic-structure approach. We therefore derive a phonon alloy band-structure (vibrational-mode) approach based on our tight-binding electronic-structure method, modifying the band-determination method to accommodate the different physical situation. Using the method, we study In(x)Ga(1-x)As alloys and find very good agreement with available experiments.},

To date, the pool of two-dimensional materials (2DMs) continues to grow at an accelerated pace and already covers an extensive range of fascinating and technologically relevant properties. An array of experimental techniques have been developed and used to characterize and understand these properties. In particular, Raman spectroscopy has proven to be a key experimental technique, thanks to its capability to identify minute structural and electronic effects in nondestructive measurements. While high-frequency (HF) intralayer Raman modes have been extensively employed for 2DMs, recent experimental and theoretical progress has demonstrated that low-frequency (LF) interlayer Raman modes are more effective at determining layer numbers and stacking configurations and provide a unique opportunity to study interlayer coupling. These advantages are due to 2DMs' unique interlayer vibration patterns where each layer behaves as an almost rigidly moving object with restoring forces corresponding to weak interlayer interactions. Compared to HF Raman modes, the relatively small attention originally devoted to LF Raman modes is largely due to their weaker signal and their proximity to the strong Rayleigh line background, which previously made their detection challenging. Recent progress in Raman spectroscopy with technical and hardware upgrades now makes it possible to probe LF modes with a standard single-stage Raman system and has proven crucial to characterize and understand properties of 2DMs. Here, we present a comprehensive and forward-looking review on the current status of exploiting LF Raman modes of 2DMs from both experimental and theoretical perspectives, revealing the fundamental physics and technological significance of LF Raman modes in advancing the field of 2DMs. We review a broad array of materials, with varying thickness and stacking configurations, discuss the effect of in-plane anisotropy, and present a generalized linear chain model and interlayer bond polarizability model to rationalize the experimental findings. We also discuss the instrumental improvements of Raman spectroscopy to enhance and separate LF Raman signals from the Rayleigh line.

Despite sustained investigation, a fully satisfactory theory of the twist bilayer remains elusive. The outstanding problems are (i) to find a theoretically unified description of the large- and small-angle limits, and (ii) to demonstrate agreement between the low-energy effective Hamiltonian and, for instance, ab initio or tight-binding calculations. In this article, we develop a low-energy theory that in the large-angle limit reproduces the symmetry-derived Hamiltonians of Mele [Phys. Rev. B 81, 161405 (2010)], and in the small-angle limit shows almost perfect agreement with tight-binding calculations. The small-angle effective Hamiltonian is that of Bistritzer and MacDonald [Proc.

Since its experimental discovery, graphene continues to attract enormous interest, in particular as a new kind of matter, in which electron transport is governed by a Dirac-like wave equation, and as a model system for studying electronic and phonon properties of other, more complex, graphitic materials[1-4]. Here, we uncover the constitutive relation of graphene and probe new physics of its optical phonons, by studying its Raman spectrum as a function of uniaxial strain. We find that the doubly degenerate E2g optical mode splits in two components, one polarized along the strain and the other perpendicular to it. This leads to the splitting of the G peak into two bands, which we call G+ and G-, by analogy with the effect of curvature on the nanotube G peak[5-7]. Both peaks red shift with increasing strain, and their splitting increases, in excellent agreement with first-principles calculations. Their relative intensities are found to depend on light polarization, which provides a useful tool to probe the graphene crystallographic orientation with respect to the strain. The singly degenerate 2D and 2D' bands also red shift, but do not split for small strains. We study the Gruneisen parameters for the phonons responsible for the G, D and D' peaks. These can be used to measure the amount of uniaxial or biaxial strain, providing a fundamental tool for nanoelectronics, where strain monitoring is of paramount importance[8, 9]},

  abstract = {The quest for materials capable of realizing the next generation of electronic and photonic devices continues to fuel research on the electronic, optical and vibrational properties of graphene. Few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes with less than ten layers each show a distinctive band structure. Thus, there is an increasing interest in the physics and applications of FLGs. Raman spectroscopy is one of the most useful and versatile tools to probe graphene samples. Here, we uncover the interlayer shear mode of FLGs, ranging from bilayer graphene (BLG) to bulk graphite, and suggest that the corresponding Raman peak measures the interlayer coupling. This peak scales from \textasciitilde{}43 cm-1 in bulk graphite to \textasciitilde{}31 cm-1 in BLG. Its low energy makes it sensitive to near-Dirac point quasiparticles. Similar shear modes are expected in all layered materials, providing a direct probe of interlayer interactions.},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is an integral part of graphene research. It is used to determine the number and orientation of layers, the quality and types of edge, and the effects of perturbations, such as electric and magnetic fields, strain, doping, disorder and functional groups. This, in turn, provides insight into all sp2-bonded carbon allotropes, because graphene is their fundamental building block. Here we review the state of the art, future directions and open questions in Raman spectroscopy of graphene. We describe essential physical processes whose importance has only recently been recognized, such as the various types of resonance at play, and the role of quantum interference. We update all basic concepts and notations, and propose a terminology that is able to describe any result in literature. We finally highlight the potential of Raman spectroscopy for layered materials other than graphene.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have been extensively studied owing to their fascinating and technologically relevant properties. Their functionalities can be often tailored by the interlayer stacking pattern. Low-frequency (LF) Raman spectroscopy provides a quick, non-destructive and inexpensive optical technique for stacking characterization, since the intensities of LF interlayer vibrational modes are sensitive to the details of the stacking. A simple and generalized interlayer bond polarizability model is proposed here to explain and predict how the LF Raman intensities depend on complex stacking sequences for any thickness in a broad array of 2D materials, including graphene, MoS2, MoSe2, NbSe2, Bi2Se3, GaSe, h-BN, etc. Additionally, a general strategy is proposed to unify the stacking nomenclature for these 2D materials. Our model reveals the fundamental mechanism of LF Raman response to the stacking, and provides general rules for stacking identification.},

This effect is commonly observed in graphite, where the rotation between graphene layers generates Moir\'e patterns in scanning tunneling microscopy images. Here, a study of intravalley and intervalley double-resonance Raman processes mediated by static potentials in rotationally stacked bilayer graphene is presented. The peak properties depend on the mismatch rotation angle and can be used as an optical signature for superlattices in bilayer graphene. An atomic force microscopy system is used to produce and identify specific rotationally stacked bilayer graphenes that demonstrate the validity of our model.},

Based on the DFT-D calculations, a new classical potential for interaction between graphene layers is developed. Molecular dynamics simulations of relative translational vibrations of graphene layers demonstrate that the choice of the classical potential considerably affects dynamic characteristics of graphene-based systems. The calculated low values of the Q-factor for these vibrations Q $\approx$ 10\textendash{}100 show that graphene should be perfect for the use in fast-responding nanorelays and nanoelectromechanical memory cells.},

The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently\textemdash{}those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},
